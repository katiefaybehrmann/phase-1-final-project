The handcrafted nature and slow production cycle of independent designer jewelry means they’re produced in smaller quantities, which makes them more exclusive. This particular artist uses reused and salvaged materials, thus not creating demand for new materials."

When it comes to textiles and clothing, about 50% of energy input to the textile industry is lost onsite. And manufacturing new furniture generates 100 times more greenhouse gases as refinishing does. Buying secondhand goods means you’re not creating a demand for new items that require additional energy or deplete even more natural resources. Goodwill has been known to exploit their workers for minimum wage, however."
